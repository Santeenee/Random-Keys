# Random-Keys

## Why

I just imagined an app where I can visualize a (pseudo)random key and then I would have to play the relative scale.

## Notes

Prints random keys (min or major, with or without #, etc.)

run `tsc -w --pretty app.ts --outFile public/script.js`

(checkout .vscode/tasks.json)

so that you work in 'app.ts' but everything gets compiled to 'script.js'
